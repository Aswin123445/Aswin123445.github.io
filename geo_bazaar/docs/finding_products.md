# Problem with Finding Location-Specific Products

Finding new products for the project has been a challenging task, as every product needs to have a strong traditional or cultural relationship with a specific location. This requirement adds a layer of complexity, as not all products are clearly categorized based on geographic or cultural relevance. 

To address this challenge, I have implemented a system that allows users to inform the platform about geo-specific products available in their region. This system enables users to submit details about locally unique or culturally significant products, which are then reviewed and added to the platform. By incorporating user input, we ensure that the products listed reflect the true cultural and regional significance, providing a more accurate and diverse catalog.

This user-driven approach helps overcome the challenge of sourcing location-specific products, ensuring that the platform can showcase authentic, geographically relevant items while maintaining an engaging experience for customers.
